# weather-dashboard

## In this application, I created a Javascript quiz game. The user clicks the start button, and a 60 second timer begins. They are given five questions to answer. If they choose a wrong answer, the timer subtracts ten seconds. Once the user finishes, they are brought to a high score page, which shows them their score, and allows them to input their name and store their high score.
